# Investment Calculator React Project

This project serves as a practical exercise to reinforce React essentials, allowing practice component creation, state management, two-way binding, and lifting state up. The goal is to create a financial tool that enables users to simulate and analyze the growth of their investments over a specified duration.

## Features

### User Input Section

- **Initial Investment:** Input the amount you initially invest.
- **Annual Investment:** Specify the annual amount you plan to invest.
- **Expected Return:** Input the expected annual return on your investments.
- **Duration:** Define the investment duration in years.

### Results Section

- The app calculates and displays a detailed table of investment results over the specified duration.
- The table includes information such as the year, investment value, interest accrued, and total invested capital.

## State Management

- The project incorporates state management using React's useState hook.
- Two-way binding ensures that user input fields are connected to the application state, ensuring a seamless update of the UI.

## Form Validation

- Duration Validation: The project includes a simple form validation to ensure users enter a valid duration greater than zero.
- Error message: Users receive feedback if an invalid duration is entered.

## Component Structure

- **Header:** Displays the project title and logo.
- **UserInput:** Manages user input for initial investment, annual investment, expected return, and duration.
- **Results:** Calculates and presents the investment results in a tabular format.

## Usage

1. Users input their financial details in the User Input section.
2. The application dynamically updates and validates the input.
3. Investment results are displayed in the Results section, providing insights into the growth of the investment over the specified duration.

## Objective

The primary goal of the Investment Calculator project is to reinforce React fundamentals, including component creation, state management, two-way binding, and lifting state up.
